          Age calculator is an online tool with which you can find out your age
          using your date of birth and the current date. The tool helps to find
          out the difference in time between two dates. The result is displayed
          in years, months, weeks, and days. The results are also not affected
          by the time zone of a person since the tool just tells you the
          difference in time. The age calculator is based on the common age
          system, therefore it can be used by everyone.
        </p>

        <p>
          The age of a person can be counted differently in different cultures.
          This calculator is based on the most common age system. In this
          system, age grows at the birthday. For example, the age of a person
          that has lived for 3 years and 11 months is 3 and the age will turn to
          4 at his/her next birthday one month later. Most western countries use
          this age system.
        </p>

        <p>
          In some cultures, age is expressed by counting years with or without
          including the current year. For example, one person who is twenty
          years old is the same as one person who is in the twenty-first year of
          his/her life. In one of the traditional Chinese age systems, people
          are born at age 1 and the age grows up at the Traditional Chinese New
          Year instead of birthday. For example, if one baby was born just one
          day before the Traditional Chinese New Year, 2 days later, the baby
          will be at age 2 even though he/she is only 2 days old.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some situations, the months and days result of this age calculator
          may be confusing, especially when the starting date is the end of a
          month. For example, we all count Feb. 20 to March 20 to be one month.
          However, there are two ways to calculate the age from Feb. 28, 2015 to
          Mar. 31, 2015. If thinking Feb. 28 to Mar. 28 as one month, then the
          result is one month and 3 days. If thinking both Feb. 28 and Mar. 31
          as the end of the month, then the result is one month. Both
          calculation results are reasonable. Similar situations exist for dates
          like Apr. 30 to May 31, May 30 to June 30, etc. The confusion comes
          from the uneven number of days in different months. In our
          calculation, we used the former method.
